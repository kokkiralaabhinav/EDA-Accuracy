# EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)-Accuracy
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis project to find the accuracy of the dataset part of machine learning; this helps to understand and analyze raw data by preprocessing and drawing insights. This project is done using some Python Visualization tools and libraries.
## How accurate is EDA sensor-
The result showed that EDA could classify the stress level with over 94% accuracy.
## How is EDA measured-
Measuring EDA consists of measuring the electrical conductance, resistance, impedance, or admittance (depending on the recording method) of the skin. Most often, skin conductance is measured and expressed in microsiemens (Î¼S).
## What are EDA readings-
Electrodermal activity (EDA; sometimes known as galvanic skin response, or GSR) refers to the variation of the electrical conductance of the skin in response to sweat secretion (often in minute amounts).
